# Evaluation Run 24.04.2021 Instructions
## Installation
1. Install arena-rosnav according to docs/Installation.md
  * remember the installation in on **local_planner_subgoalmode** branch, otherwise *rosws update* may install different packages in *src/forks*)
    ``` 
    git checkout local_planner_subgoalmode
    ```
  * then pull the most recent forks (in "../arena_rosnav"):
    ``` 
    rosws update
    ```
  * install necessary packages
    ```
    sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-nlopt
    workon rosnav
    pip install filelock
    ```

  * remember catkin_make always with *release* and *python3* (in ../catkin_ws):
    ```
    catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3
    ```
  * rememeber source in new terminal
    ```
    source devel/setup.zsh
    or
    source devel/setup.sh
    ```

2. Make sure you are inside your venv when you start the commands
3. Make sure your python path is correct by sourcing everything before you start the commands
- echo $PYTHONPATH should output smt like this: 
```
/home/user/catkin_ws/devel/lib/python3/dist-packages:
/home/user/catkin_ws/src/arena-rosnav:
/home/user/geometry2_ws/devel/lib/python3/dist-packages:
/opt/ros/melodic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
```
## [EVAL Group1] Run rule_[00, 01, 02, 04] agents:

1. [Terminal 1] Start the *simulation environment* with the specific scenario e.g. map1, 20 obstacles:
```
roslaunch arena_bringup start_arena_flatland.launch map_file:="map1"  disable_scenario:="false" scenario_file:="eval/obstacle_map1_obs20.json"
```
* roslaunch parameters:
  * map_file:
    * map0
    * map1
    * map_empty
    * maps_girl/complex_map_1
    * maps_girl/open_field_2
  * disable_scenario: false
  * scenario_file:
    * eval/map0_obs5.json
    * eval/map0_obs10.json
    * eval/map0_obs20.json
    * eval/obstacle_map1_obs5.json
    * eval/obstacle_map1_obs10.json
    * eval/obstacle_map1_obs20.json
    * eval/empty_map_obs05.json
    * eval/empty_map_obs10.json
    * eval/empty_map_obs20.json
    * eval/empty_map_obs30.json
    * eval/complex_map_1_obs5.json
    * eval/complex_map_1_obs10.json
    * eval/complex_map_1_obs20.json
    * eval/open_field_2_obs5.json
    * eval/open_field_2_obs10.json
    * eval/open_field_2_obs20.json

1. [Terminal 2] Start rosbag recording and name it with following convention: planner_map_obstacles
```
rosbag record -o drl1_map1_obs20 /scenario_reset -e "(.*)police(.*)"

```
* rosbag parameter
  * name of the bag: 
    * [local_planner]_ [map_name]_ obs[number]_ vel[obs_velocity_magnitude]_ [subgoal_mode]
    * example1: drl1_map1_obs20_vel01_spatialhorizon
    * example2: mpc_map_obs10_vel02_timespace 
    * example3: teb_map_obs10_vel03_subsampling 

Explanation:
* this command will record all topics necessary for evaluation
* -e "(.*)police(.*)": records all topics containing "police"
* *drl1_map1_ob20_vel_01_spatialhorizon*: name of bag file, in this example the drl1 planner was recorded in map1 with 20 obstacles with lin_vel = 0.1 and as intermediate planner spatial horizon was chosen




1. [Terminal 3] Run the ```run_agent.py``` script.

```
roscd arena_local_planner_drl/scripts/deployment/
```

```
python run_agent.py --load rule_00 --scenario obstacle_map1_obs20
```
* change drl planner:
  * --load rule_00
  * --load rule_01
  * --load rule_02
  * --load rule_04
* scenario_file:
  * eval/map0_obs5
  * eval/map0_obs10
  * eval/map0_obs20
  * eval/obstacle_map1_obs5
  * eval/obstacle_map1_obs10
  * eval/obstacle_map1_obs20
  * eval/empty_map_obs05
  * eval/empty_map_obs10
  * eval/empty_map_obs20
  * eval/empty_map_obs30
  * eval/complex_map_1_obs5
  * eval/complex_map_1_obs10
  * eval/complex_map_1_obs20
  * eval/open_field_2_obs5
  * eval/open_field_2_obs10
  * eval/open_field_2_obs20

###Note: 
- for the run script it's not necessary to input the right scene, since the simulation environment already loaded the respective scene
- warnings like these can be ignored (occurs because the simulation already spawned obstacles)
```
Flatland YAML: Model with name "obstacle_dynamic_with_traj_00" already exists
```

#### If you want to check the current scenario progress:
```
rostopic echo /scenario_reset
```
This will display the reset count. Once the resets reach the max nr of repeats (set up in the json file), the robot should stay at the goal position. Then you can stop the recording.


Once the test runs finished (after 15 runs):
- stop the rosbag record (rosbag will be saved in the directory where you executed the command)
- stop the run_agent.py script 
- stop the simulation environment
- change the parameters inside the scenario.json if neccessary (obstacle velocity),tipp: search and replace "linear_velocity": 0.3 with the new velocity e.g. 0.2 for all obstacles
- start again from step 1 with new agents/scenarios/parameters

## [EVAL Group2] RUN CADRL, MPC, RL-CA, TEB

0. Install Dependencies:
DRL based local planners need some dependencies to be installed in order to run correctly.  
These can be found in the directory: arena-rosnav/arena_navigation/arena_local_planner/env
- cadrl:
  - pip install tensorflow==1.4.1
  - pip install numpy
  - build ford msg package in your catkin ws: 
    ``` 
    git clone https://bitbucket.org/acl-swarm/ford_msgs/src/master/ 
    catkin_make 
    ```  
- col-rl:
  - pip install mpi4py


1. [Terminal 1] Start the simulation with the respective local planners by setting the parameter local_planner (ie "teb"):

```
roslaunch arena_bringup start_arena_flatland.launch local_planner:="teb" map_file:="map1"  disable_scenario:="false" scenario_file:="eval/obstacle_map1_obs20.json" 
```
below commands 2. and 3. not necessary for teb mpc and dwa !

2. [Terminal 2] Start the plan manager :

```
roslaunch arena_bringup timed_space_planner_fsm.launch
```

* roslaunch parameters:
  * local_planner:
    * teb
    * mpc
    * dwa
    * cadrl
    * rlca
  * map_file:
    * map0
    * map1
    * map_empty
    * maps_girl/complex_map_1
    * maps_girl/open_field_2
  * disable_scenario: false
  * scenario_file:
    * eval/map0_obs5
    * eval/map0_obs10
    * eval/map0_obs20
    * eval/obstacle_map1_obs5
    * eval/obstacle_map1_obs10
    * eval/obstacle_map1_obs20
    * eval/empty_map_obs05
    * eval/empty_map_obs10
    * eval/empty_map_obs20
    * eval/empty_map_obs30
    * eval/complex_map_1_obs5
    * eval/complex_map_1_obs10
    * eval/complex_map_1_obs20
    * eval/open_field_2_obs5
    * eval/open_field_2_obs10
    * eval/open_field_2_obs20

For arena local planner, an additional Terminal is needed (first terminal can be set to teb):
```
roscd arena_ros/scripts/
python arena_node_tb3.py
```

1. [Terminal 3] Start rosbag recording and name it with following convention: planner_map_obstacles_velocity_subgoal_mode
```
rosbag record -o mpc_map1_obs20 /scenario_reset -e "(.*)police(.*)"

```
* rosbag parameter
  * name of the bag: 
    * [local_planner]_ [map_name]_ obs[number]_ vel[obs_velocity_magnitude]_ [subgoal_mode]
    * example1: drl1_map1_obs20_vel01_spatialhorizon
    * example2: mpc_map_obs10_vel02_timespace 
    * example3: teb_map_obs10_vel03_subsampling 



Explanation:
* this command will record all topics necessary for evaluation
* -e "(.*)police(.*)": records all topics containing "police"
* cadrl_map1_ob10_vel_01_spatialhorizon: name of bag file, in this example the cadrl planner was recorded in map1 with 10 obstacles with lin_vel = 0.1 and spatial planner was chosen as intermediate planner.

#### If you want to check the current scenario progress:
```
rostopic echo /scenario_reset
```
This will display the reset count. Once the resets reach the max nr of repeats (set up in the json file), the robot should stay at the goal position. Then you can stop the recording.

Once the test runs finished (after 15 runs):
- stop the rosbag record (rosbag will be saved in the directory where you executed the command)
- stop the run_agent.py script 
- stop the simulation environment
- change the parameters inside the scenario.json if neccessary (obstacle velocity),tipp: search and replace "linear_velocity": 0.3 with the new vel e.g. 0.2
- start again from step 1 with new agents/scenarios/parameters

## [Additional Notes]: Verify the simulation

Once the simulation has started, you can check if these three topics are published:
``` 
rostopic list
```
* /scenario_reset
* /sensorsim/police/collision
* /sensorsim/police/odom

When using "teb", "dwa" or "mpc" you need to start the scenario by manually putting a "2D Nav Goal" once. After each reset the goal will automatically set. If everything worked you can continue to step 2)

## [Others] Run Ego Planner

In order to test ego local planner:

1. change the parameter "use_drl" to be false in *plan_fsm_param.yaml*
```
src/arena-rosnav/arena_bringup/launch/plan_fsm_param.yaml
```
* use_drl false


2. start *simulation environment*

You can choose with or wihout scenarios loaded
* without senarios:
```
roslaunch arena_bringup start_arena_flatland.launch map_file:="map1"
```
* with senarios:
```
roslaunch arena_bringup start_arena_flatland.launch map_file:="map1"  disable_scenario:="false" scenario_file:="eval/obstacle_map1_obs20.json"
```
3. in rviz set a goal position using *FlatlandNav Goal*
