	 * results, but also has a significantly higher time requirement.
	 * This method supports the progress-bar mechanism.
	 *
	 * @note Flipping edges makes the triangulation non-delaunay, i.e.
	 * the empty-circle-property is then no longer given. Improving the
	 * smoothness of the surface by edge flips also means degrading the

	 * A Delaunay triangulation is not unique when when 2 or more triangles
	 * share a common circumcircle. As a consequence the four corners of
	 * a rectangle can be triangulated in two different ways: Either the
	 * diagonal proceeds from the lower left to the upper right corner
	 * or it connects the other two corners. Both solutions are valid and

	 * the repeatability and for reasons of visual appearance this method
	 * unifies such diagonals such that they point from the lower left to
	 * the upper right corner (or in horizontal direction).\n
	 *
	 * Moreover a Delaunay triangulation does not take the z-value into
	 * account and thus valleys and ridges may be disturbed. The present
	 * method flips diagonals such that they point from the lower left to
	 * the upper right corner of a quad. And if the 2.5D lengths of the

	 * @param tolerance2D is 0 when only exact cases of more than 3 points

	 * data can be disturbed by noise and tiny rounding errors such that
	 * grid points are not exactly on a grid. The numeric error is computed
	 * as \f$error=\frac{abs(diagonalA-diagonalB)}{max(diagonalA,diagonalB)}\f$.
	 * and \p tolerance2D is an upper threshold to allow modification despite
	 * such tiny inaccuracies.
	 * @param lowerThreshold25D is used to take also the heights of the
	 * involved points into account. For example, the points\n
	 * \n
	 * Point_2 a(0,0,0);\n
	 * Point_2 b(10,0,0);\n
	 * Point_2 c(10,10,0);\n
	 * Point_2 d(0,10,1000);\n
	 * \n
	 * can form the triangles (a,b,c) and (a,c,d) or the triangles (a,b,d)
	 * and (d,b,c) but (a,c) is obviousy the better diagonal because the
	 * points a,b,c share the same elevation while d is at z=1000.
	 * Technically spoken, the diagonal with the smaller 2.5D-length is
	 * applied if the both, the 2D error is below \p tolerance2D and the
	 * 2.5D error is above \p lowerThreshold25D. The 2.5D
	 * criterion has priority over the 2D criterion.
