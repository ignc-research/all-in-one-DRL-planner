# fig 3
# Since we did not define any custom config for figure 3, the default config will be used.

# In order to do that we can just simply put an additional parameter called "folder"
# We could also ovverride the default folder param with a "custom_cfg_3", but this would apply to all planners !

# We can easily customize the output of the eval script by creating a similar yml config. 
# The user can combine any planner with anny figure even comparing planners from different runs.
# If the corresponding bag exists, any combination will work.
