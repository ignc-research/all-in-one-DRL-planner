# Each yml file should start with the default cfg block, these parameters will apply to all
# figures below in order to prevent redundant parameter definitions:

# ------------ default config block ------------
# 1: will plot, 0: will not plot
default_cfg:
    plot_trj:        1        # plot agent trajectory
    plot_zones:      1        # plot collision zones
    plot_grid:       0        # zone grid
    plot_obst:       1        # plot obstacles (start, end, direction)
    plot_collisions: 1        # plot a circle where agent collided
    plot_sm:         1        # plot static map
    plot_gp:         0        # plot global plan
    plot_subgoals:   0        # plot subgoals
    folder:          "run_4/" # folder containing the planners



# ------------ figure block ------------
# Each figure name needs to be unique
# naming convention: $map_obs$n_vel$v_$name (unique)
# $map             : name of the map 
# $n               : number of obstacles
# $v               : obstacle velocity
# $name            : an arbitary name

# fig 1
# in figure 1 we want to have the complex map with 20 obstacles and vel of 0.2
# The script will generate a "complex_obs20_vel02_testplot1.pdf" file inside plots/
# We can include any amount of plots to this figure by adding them to "planner"
# In figure 1 we want to compare three wpg's for the cadrl model
