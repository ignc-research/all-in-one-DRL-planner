# All-in-one Planner: A DRL-based Control Switch
This repository contains the code for the paper [All-in-One: A DRL-based Control Switch Combining State-of-the-art Navigation Planners](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.11636.pdf). 
The repository provides:
* A framework to integrate local planning algorihtms with ROS
* An OpenAI gym env for training of a DRL agent to learn switching between different planners based on sensor observations
* Evaluation files for different maps
The evaluation environments were createed with our open source project [arena-tools](https://github.com/ignc-research/arena-tools), which lets you create a variety of static and dynamic indoor and outdoor scenarios.
